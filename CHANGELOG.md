## Completed Deliverables

### ✅ Phase 0 Audit & CI/CD Reliability Fixes - COMPLETE (July 1, 2026)

**Status**: 🟢 COMPLETE
**Completion Date**: July 1, 2026

**Context**: A full audit of every claimed-complete item in this repo's docs against actual file evidence (Terraform modules, GitHub workflows, PowerShell scripts) found several real code-level bugs behind the docs sprawl, not just stale documentation.

**What Was Fixed**:
- ✅ **OIDC pull_request gap** — `scripts/Start-LandingZoneBootstrap.ps1` only created a federated credential subject for `ref:refs/heads/main`. `terraform-plan.yml` triggers Azure OIDC login on `pull_request` events, which GitHub issues a `pull_request`-subject token for — no existing credential matched, so every PR-triggered CI run failed OIDC login by design (confirmed: zero successful runs of `terraform-plan.yml`/`terraform-apply.yml`/`010-terraform-init.yml`/`020-rbac-validation.yml` in repo history prior to this fix). Added `repo:OWNER/REPO:pull_request` federated credential to the bootloader.
- ✅ **SHA pinning inconsistency** — `010-TERRAFORM-INIT.yml` and `020-RBAC-VALIDATION.yml` used `@v4`/`@v2`/`@v3`/`@v7` tag refs while every other workflow in the repo pins to commit SHAs (and `action-pinning-policy.yml`'s own check would fail against exactly this pattern). Pinned both files to the SHAs already used elsewhere in the repo for the same actions.
- ✅ **Conflicting `required_version` blocks** — `terraform/modules/keyvault-cmk/main.tf` and `terraform/modules/sentinel-siem/main.tf` each had a stray second `terraform { required_version = ">= 1.9.0" }` block that contradicted the `~> 1.6` constraint in the module's own `terraform.tf` (the standard used by all 11 modules). Removed the stray blocks.

**Repo cleanup — bootstrap scripts and naming** (2026-07-01):
- ✅ Deleted `scripts/Initialize-LandingZone.ps1` and `scripts/Start-Bootstrap.ps1` — both implemented a stale "spin up a separate customer repo" model that isn't how this repo actually works. `Start-LandingZoneBootstrap.ps1` is the confirmed real, sole entry point.
- ✅ Renamed all scripts to a consistent PowerShell Verb-Noun convention: `000_LZ_Bootloader.ps1` → `scripts/Start-LandingZoneBootstrap.ps1`, `alz-config.ps1` → `scripts/Get-AlzConfig.ps1`. Updated every reference across workflows and docs.
- ✅ Fixed stale `.azure/deployment-options.yaml` reference in `keyvault-cmk` and `sentinel-siem` module READMEs — only `.azure/deployment-options.yaml.example` exists; READMEs now say to copy it first.

**What Was Found But Deferred** (see [TODO.md](TODO.md)):
- 🟦 Backend inconsistency: bootloader/workflow-010 reference Terraform Cloud, but `terraform-plan.yml`/`terraform-apply.yml`/all `terraform/live/*/backend.hcl` use native `azurerm` backend. Decision: adopt TFC — tracked as [GitHub Issue #11](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-Plan_LZDeployment/issues/11), blocked on interactive TFC org/workspace/token setup.
- 🟦 `Microsoft.ApiManagement` claimed but not implemented in the TLS 1.2 policy initiative (5 of 6 claimed services actually covered).
- 🟦 6 of 11 Terraform modules missing README.md.
- 🟦 `keyvault-cmk` and `sentinel-siem` modules are scaffold-only stubs (zero real resources), not implemented despite being referenced as available optional modules in some docs.
- 🟦 4 utility scripts (`Configure-DeploymentOptions.ps1`, `Invoke-BulkOperations.ps1`, `Validate-ALZDeployment.ps1`, `Verify-CostAccuracy.ps1`) have no call site anywhere in the pipeline — disposition (wire in vs. relocate) still open.

**Documentation cleanup**: Consolidated 8 duplicative PR-artifact docs describing the same static-generator build into a single entry below; rewrote TODO.md to hold only pending work (all completed items moved here), matching what this repo actually does (self-deploying landing zone via `Start-LandingZoneBootstrap.ps1` + numbered workflows + Terraform, plus a separate optional static `.tfvars` generator) rather than the previously-planned Node/React/Express/Docker/OAuth "web app" that was never built.

### ✅ Static Config-Generator Frontend: Official ALZ Rebuild - COMPLETE (July 1, 2026)

**Status**: 🟢 COMPLETE  
**Completion Date**: July 1, 2026  
**Effort**: ~8 hours (Phase 1: 4h research, Phase 2: 4h implementation)  
**Git Commits**:
- `77131ea` feat: complete Phase 2 - official ALZ generator implementation (#9), merged 2026-07-01 05:08:23 UTC via PR #9 (branch `feature/official-alz-generator-phase2`, 11 files changed, +5218/-567)

**What This Is**: `frontend/` is a static, backend-free HTML/JS/CSS tool. A user fills out a form describing their desired Landing Zone, and `OfficialALZGenerator` (in `frontend/app.js`) generates a `.tfvars` file entirely client-side — no server, no build step, no auth. The user downloads/copies the file and feeds it to the Terraform workflows (`terraform-plan.yml` / `terraform-apply.yml`) manually or via `generate-and-release.yml`. This superseded an earlier, unfinished draft of the same page that had MSAL auth stubs and planned a Node/Express backend — that direction was abandoned in favor of the zero-backend static approach (8h vs. an estimated 18-20h for a backend API).

**What Was Delivered**:
- Official ALZ generator grounded in the official Azure Landing Zones docs (not guessed fields)
- 47 official policy assignments across 5 management-group scopes (Intermediate Root, Platform, Landing Zones, Landing Zones/Corp, Specialized) — sourced from the official ALZ reference, not the "50+" figure quoted in earlier drafts
- 2 official network topologies (hub-spoke VNet, Virtual WAN)
- 16 official customization options (resource naming, MG name overrides, feature toggles, policy effect overrides, etc.)
- Region auto-pairing (official Azure region pairs) and dynamic environment suffixes (prod/dev/test/staging)
- Real-time CAF naming examples, auto-populated environment tags
- 9-section form UI, mobile-responsive, no external dependencies
- Valid `.tfvars` generation matching the structure the `terraform/live/*` layers expect

**Frontend Files**:
- `frontend/app.js` (988 lines) — `OfficialALZGenerator` class
- `frontend/index.html` (411 lines) — 9 form sections, policy checkboxes
- `frontend/styles.css` (423 lines) — styling, responsive layout

**Acceptance Criteria Met**:
- All policy names and variable names sourced from official ALZ documentation/accelerator
- All 16 customization options implemented
- 2 official network topologies only (no invented options)
- Official Azure region pairs used for auto-pairing
- Generated `.tfvars` matches the structure Terraform expects
- Form validation on all required fields; mobile responsive; cross-browser tested (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

**Key Achievement**: Replaced a guessed-at, half-wired generator (with dead MSAL/backend stubs) with a production-ready, zero-backend tool grounded in official Azure Landing Zones architecture.

**Documentation note**: This entry consolidates and replaces 8 separate PR-artifact docs that previously described this same build from different angles (`PROJECT_COMPLETION_STATUS.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`, `PHASE_2_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`, `README_PHASE_2_COMPLETE.md`, `MERGE_COMPLETE.md`, `PHASE_1_PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`, `PHASE_2_UX_IMPROVEMENTS.md`, `COMPONENTS_STATUS.md`), all removed as part of Phase 0 doc reconciliation (2026-07-01). `COMPONENTS_STATUS.md` in particular had gone stale — it described an older draft of `frontend/` (MSAL auth, "Deploy to Azure" button, planned Express backend) that no longer matches the current static-generator implementation. Remaining reference docs — `PHASE_1_PREP_STAGE_INVENTORY.md`, `PHASE_2_BUILD_PLAN.md`, `FORM_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` — still exist under `docs/` as design-detail background but are not treated as status/completion claims.

### ✅ AVM Phase 1: Foundation - COMPLETE (June 30, 2026)

**Status**: 🟢 COMPLETE  
**Completion Date**: June 30, 2026  
**Effort**: ~2 hours  
**Git Commits**:
- `400a662` chore: complete AVM Phase 1 compliance - terraform.tf & .terraform-docs.yml
- `d71c3bf` docs: add AVM session summary and quick reference guide
- `a6cb0e1` docs: add implementation complete summary and checklist
- `90c2956` docs: add AVM documentation index and navigation guide
- `2ebfd11` docs: update TODO.md with AVM Phase completion and deployment blockers
- `69814e0` docs: add critical next steps before deployment guide

**What Was Delivered**:
- ✅ terraform.tf files: 10 created + 1 fixed (all 11 modules)
- ✅ .terraform-docs.yml files: 11 created (auto-documentation)
- ✅ Removed all provider blocks from modules (TFNFR27 compliance)
- ✅ All modules pass terraform validate & fmt
- ✅ 6 comprehensive documentation guides created

**Modules Compliant**: 11/11 on `terraform.tf` + `.terraform-docs.yml` structure (verified 2026-07-01)
- backup-baseline, defender-baseline, hub-network, keyvault-cmk
- management-baseline, management-groups, nsg-flow-logs
- policy-baseline, sandbox, sentinel-siem, spoke-network

**Acceptance Criteria Met**:
- ✅ TFNFR25: terraform.tf exists in all modules with `~> 1.6` Terraform, `~> 4.0` azurerm
- ✅ TFNFR26: required_providers block defined
- ✅ TFNFR27: No provider blocks in modules (delegated to root) — confirmed clean, zero matches on re-audit
- ✅ TFNFR2: .terraform-docs.yml configured for all modules
- ⚠️ 6 of 11 modules still lack a `README.md` (`backup-baseline`, `hub-network`, `management-baseline`, `management-groups`, `policy-baseline`, `spoke-network`) — tracked in [TODO.md](TODO.md) Phase 2
- ⚠️ `keyvault-cmk` and `sentinel-siem` are scaffold-only stubs with zero real resources, not full modules — tracked in [TODO.md](TODO.md) Phase 2

**Documentation note**: The 6 documentation files originally listed here (AVM-INDEX.md, AVM-QUICK-REFERENCE.md, IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE-SUMMARY.md, SESSION-SUMMARY-AVM-PHASE1.md, AVM-COMPLIANCE-PHASE-1-COMPLETE.md, AVM-IMPLEMENTATION-STRATEGY.md) are referenced by the commit messages above but do not exist anywhere in the current repo tree (verified 2026-07-01 via full-repo glob) — either deleted in a later commit or never actually included in the diff despite the commit message. Removed from this entry as unverifiable; the `terraform.tf`/`.terraform-docs.yml` deliverables themselves are independently confirmed to exist.

## Previously Completed (From Initial Repo State)

### ✅ Bootstrap - GitHub Repository & Branch Protection

**Status**: 🟢 CONFIRMED (verified 2026-07-01 via `gh api`)
**What's In Place**:
- ✅ GitHub repository `HCW-Demo-LZDeployment` (owner: `saulpatinojr`) exists and is active
- ✅ Branch protection ruleset active on `main`: `enforce_admins`, `required_linear_history`, no force pushes, no deletions, required conversation resolution
- ⚠️ Required approving review count is 0 — protection exists structurally but doesn't require human review (tracked in [TODO.md](TODO.md) Phase 4)
- ⚠️ OIDC federation, CI/CD workflows, and end-to-end pipeline health are tracked separately in [TODO.md](TODO.md) Phase 1 — as of 2026-07-01 the pipeline has no recorded successful run (root cause identified and fixed; verification pending)

---

### ✅ PowerShell Sandbox Cleanup Script

**Status**: 🟢 CONFIRMED (verified 2026-07-01 by direct code read)
**What's In Place** — `terraform/scripts/Cleanup-ExpiredSandboxResources.ps1`:
- ✅ GUID format validation on subscription ID input (`[ValidatePattern(...)]`)
- ✅ Subscription existence check via `Get-AzSubscription`
- ✅ Sandbox tag validation (`purpose=sandbox`, throws "SAFETY VIOLATION" if absent)
- ✅ Dry-run capability (`-DryRun`, default `true`), requires explicit `-Confirm` for real deletion
- ✅ Max deletion limit (`-MaxDeletions`, default 100)
- ⚠️ Log Analytics audit trail is a stub — `Write-AuditLog` prints structured JSON to console but does not call the Data Collector API; the code has a comment noting this ("In production, integrate with Send-AzOperationalInsightsDataCollector")

---

## Summary Statistics

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Terraform Modules** | 11 | 9 implemented, 2 scaffold-only stubs (`keyvault-cmk`, `sentinel-siem`) |
| **GitHub Workflows** | 10 | All SHA-pinned as of 2026-07-01 |
| **Frontend** | 1 static generator | Zero-backend, `.tfvars` output |
