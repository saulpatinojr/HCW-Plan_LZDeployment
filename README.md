# HCW Azure Landing Zone Deployment

## Overview

This repository **is** the landing zone deployment — it is not a template that spins up a separate customer repository. Running the bootstrap script and merging the resulting workflows deploys Azure infrastructure directly from this repo, in place.

**How it works**:

1. **`scripts/Start-LandingZoneBootstrap.ps1`** — the single local entry point. Validates required CLI tools (`az`, `gh`, `git`, `terraform`), authenticates to Azure/GitHub/Terraform Cloud, creates the OIDC service principal(s) and federated credentials, sets GitHub secrets/variables/environments, and configures the Terraform Cloud workspace.
2. **Numbered GitHub Actions workflows** (`.github/workflows/010-*.yml`, `020-*.yml`, ...) plus `terraform-plan.yml`/`terraform-apply.yml` pick up from there and, together with the Terraform code under `terraform/`, actually deliver the landing zone.
3. **`frontend/`** is a separate, optional static HTML/JS page (no backend, no build step) where a user can visually pick deployment options and generate a `.tfvars` file, which then feeds into the same Terraform/workflow pipeline.

> **Status**: The CI/CD pipeline has known reliability issues currently being fixed — see [TODO.md](TODO.md) before relying on it for a real deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Azure CLI 2.69+
- Terraform 1.9+
- GitHub CLI 2.67+
- Git 2.43+
- Owner/User Access Administrator at the Azure tenant root (for OIDC/RBAC setup)
- An Azure subscription

### Bootstrap

```powershell
.\scripts\Start-LandingZoneBootstrap.ps1
```

This is idempotent — safe to re-run. It walks through, in order:

1. CLI tool validation
2. Azure / GitHub / Terraform Cloud authentication
3. Deployment configuration (org prefix, environments, region, repo name)
4. Azure OIDC service principal + federated credential creation
5. GitHub secrets/variables configuration
6. GitHub environment creation
7. Terraform Cloud workspace configuration
8. Bootstrap report generation (written to `.reports/bootstrap/`)
9. Optional PR creation with the generated bootstrap artifacts

State is tracked in `.lz-bootloader-state.json` so a failed run can be fixed and re-run without repeating completed steps.

### After Bootstrap

Once the bootstrap PR is merged, the numbered workflows take over:

- `010-terraform-init.yml` initializes Terraform and validates the workload setup
- `020-rbac-validation.yml` audits service principal RBAC (also runs weekly)
- Subsequent pushes/PRs touching `terraform/**` trigger `terraform-plan.yml` (on PR) and `terraform-apply.yml` (on merge to `main`)

Each layer under `terraform/live/` deploys independently and in dependency order: `global` → `platform-connectivity` → `platform-management` → `workloads-prod` → `sandbox`.

---

## Optional Static Configuration Generator

`frontend/` is a standalone static page — open `frontend/index.html` in a browser, no server required. It lets you pick org name, region, network topology, policy assignments, and other options, then generates a `.tfvars` file you can download or copy. Feed that file into the Terraform layer it corresponds to (`terraform apply -var-file=your-file.tfvars`). See [docs/webapp/PLAN.md](docs/webapp/PLAN.md) for details.

---

## Key Features

### Firewall Choice
Select at deployment time via the `firewall_type` variable in the `platform-connectivity` layer: Azure Firewall (`azfw`), Palo Alto (`palo`), or Fortinet (`fortinet`).

### Sandbox with Auto-Expiry
- Sandbox resources require an `expiry_date` tag (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
- `Cleanup-ExpiredSandboxResources.ps1` validates the subscription is GUID-formatted and tagged `purpose=sandbox` before touching anything, supports `-DryRun` (default on), and enforces a max-deletion limit
- The sandbox module (`terraform/modules/sandbox/`) is feature-toggled off by default (`create_sandbox_rg = false`)

### Governance via Azure Policy
Policy baseline module enforces mandatory tagging, allowed locations, NSG requirements, TLS 1.2 minimum (Storage, App Service, Function Apps, MySQL, PostgreSQL — API Management coverage not yet implemented, see [TODO.md](TODO.md)), and sandbox isolation rules.

### GitOps Workflow
- PR opened against `main` touching `terraform/**` → `terraform plan` runs, posts results to the PR
- PR merged → `terraform apply` runs per-layer, sequentially (`max-parallel: 1`)
- Production layers use a GitHub environment gate; sandbox uses its own environment

## Current Known Issues

See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for the full, current list. Highlights as of 2026-07-01:

- CI/CD pipeline has no recorded successful run yet — root cause (a missing OIDC federated credential for `pull_request`-triggered runs) has been fixed in code; live verification is pending
- Backend is currently `azurerm` native storage everywhere except the bootloader and workflow `010`, which assume Terraform Cloud — migration tracked as [GitHub Issue #11](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-Plan_LZDeployment/issues/11)
- 6 of 11 Terraform modules are missing a `README.md`
- Two modules (`keyvault-cmk`, `sentinel-siem`) are scaffold-only stubs with no real resources yet
- 4 utility scripts (`Configure-DeploymentOptions.ps1`, `Invoke-BulkOperations.ps1`, `Validate-ALZDeployment.ps1`, `Verify-CostAccuracy.ps1`) exist but aren't currently called from anywhere in the pipeline — their disposition is tracked in [TODO.md](TODO.md)

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Version |
|---|---|---|
| IaC | Terraform | 1.9+ |
| Cloud Provider | Azure | azurerm provider ~> 4.0 |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | OIDC-authenticated |
| State Backend | Azure Storage (native), migrating to Terraform Cloud | — |
| Governance | Azure Policy | Built-in + custom policy definitions |
| Config Generator | Static HTML/CSS/vanilla JS | No backend, no build step |

## Documentation

- **[TODO.md](TODO.md)** — current phase plan and open work
- **[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)** — completed work history, with verification notes
- **[docs/webapp/PLAN.md](docs/webapp/PLAN.md)** — static config-generator build plan
- **[terraform/modules/\*/README.md](terraform/modules/)** — per-module usage docs (where they exist — see Known Issues)

---

## Naming Convention

Follows [Microsoft CAF naming standards](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-naming):

- Management Groups: `mg-{scope}`
- Resource Groups: `rg-{scope}-{region}-{env}-{nn}`
- Resources: `{type}-{name}-{region}-{env}-{nn}`

## Tagging Strategy

Mandatory tags enforced via policy baseline: `owner`, `application`, `environment` (`prod`/`nonprod`/`sandbox`), `cost_center`. Sandbox resources additionally require `expiry_date`.
